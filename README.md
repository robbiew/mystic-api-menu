USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ALWAYS BACKUP FILES, INCLUDING /MYSTIC/THEMES dirs.

Refer to bgg-hotness.py for more detailed comments on how it all works.

The purpose of these files is to show an example of how APIs can be used
to pull external data from the Internet and layer them into display 
files (e.g. ANSI) to create Mystic BBS Menus that contain dynamic text.

It's just one way--my way--and hopefully you will find it useful. I'm using
Board Game Geek's (python3) API, because that's my jam.

If you do find it useful--let me know! Or if it can be improved, 
let me know as well. Nicely.

I'm indebted to all the other Mystic mod-writers out there, whom I cribbed
and adapted different techniques and formats: Phenom Productions, XQTR, 
Netsurge, Gyphon, Darryl Perry -- and many more.

And thanks to g00r00 for making such awesome software and Realm of Serion BBS
for inspiration for the ANSI 'font' and skull :)

If you use this scrript on your BBS, please use your own ANSI art!
